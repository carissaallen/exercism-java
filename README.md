# Refining my Java skills, with a little help from my friends <br>_at exercism.io_

There are so many places to grind away on coding problems (LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeFights, etc.), but that doesn't necessarily make your code any better. Although it's important to practice, I enjoy using _exercism.io_ because you have a mentor along the way who will give you a code review, and tips about the language.
